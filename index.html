  	<p> <strong>My spirit animal is apparently a bear yayyyyyyyyy </strong></p>
  	<h> Why is the Bear my spirit animal </h1>
  	<h2>According to google:</h2>
  	<p id="purple-color"> The bear spirit animal symbolizes dominion and authority, and being larger than life. 
  		It signifies respecting the laws of boundaries and standing tall against adversities. 
  		The bear meaning also speaks about protection and commitment. 
  		Just like the kind of protection and commitment that bear mothers give to their young.
  		The bear is fearless and confident. The bear spirit animal asks that you be brave and believe in yourself. 
  		Like the bear, you need to stand up for yourself, your beliefs and your rights as a sovereign being of this world and the spirit world.
