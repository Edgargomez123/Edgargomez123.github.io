				<h3 id="juju bean1"> Back to school (03/03)</h3>
					<p> It's monday and I'm back to school. When I woke up I didn't wanna get up I just didn't want to come today but
					I did get up and came to school anyways. Honestly my legs don't hurt anymore, I thought I would be in pain
					but I had a really good rest last night I guess. Today's a late start monday so I'll use the time I have
					to work on this Blog Page. I don't have a lot of time so the webpage won't look as good as I wanted it to look. </p>

				<h3 id="juju bean2"> First 8 hour shift ever (03/02) </h3>
					<p> So today, Saturday , I got to work at 12:00 pm again and I thought well I'll probably get off work at 12:30 pm
						today just as I did yesterday and then I can keep working on this webpage but THEN my boss " Jimmy " comes to me and says
						" You'll work full time today, you're off at 8:00 pm " and I was like no way, I'll be off at 8:00 !!.
						In my whole life I had never worked 8 hours straight, it was a long day. I did get tired a lot, my legs really hurt,
						at the end of the day and that's not all, my boss also told me to start taking the orders at the drive through and I hadn't even 
						memorized the menu by then but I tried my best. I did some mistakes but I think I did pretty good. </p>

				<h3 id="juju bean3"> Back to work (03/01)</h3>
					<p> It's Saturday and I'm back to work. All I've been doing at my work so far it's getting the drinks, calling up 
						orders, cleaning the tables, and other stuff but today I got there at 12:00 pm because my boss said I would work
						8 hours today, then he suddenly said to me at 2:30 pm to go home. He just said "Little by little you"ll get used to it"
						so I headed back to home.</p>

				<h3 id="juju bean4"> eLearning Day (02/28)</h3>
					<p> We finally had a Snow day at PHS. I've been waiting for this day to come, I think we all deserved a day off
						and since we hadn't had snow days before this was pretty cool. My family and I decided to spend this day off 
						going to Mishawaka's Mall. We didn't buy anything but it was cool to walk around and see different stuff.</p>

				<h3 id="juju bean5"> Track Long Distance (02/26)</h3>
					<p>I joined track a few weeks ago but all I had been doing was short distances thinking I was a good sprinter but it turned out
						I wasn't so I decided to switch to long distance running and WOW, it's crazy. We ran from the highschool to 
						webster elementary and came back, that was around 6 miles and I got really tired. For now I'll stay as a long 
						distance runner and see what happens.</p>

				<h3 id="juju bean6"> My new job (02/25)</h3>
					<p> I've been trying to find a job for months and last Monday I finally found one. I had came to this place a few weeks
						ago and they said they would call me but they never did until Saturday. My new job is at King Gyros. I don't have
						an specific schedule yet but they'll probably assign me one. I'm so excited for this new job.</p>
