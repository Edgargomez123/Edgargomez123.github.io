				<h3 id="jujubean"> First 8 hour shift ever (03/29)</h3>
					<p> Today was crazy. Today I had to work 8 hours straight, it was a long day. At the end of the day 
						my legs really hurted but I think I'll be fine tomorrow, we'll see. Today, I started taking orders 
						in the drive through and I haven't even memorized the whole menu, it was hard!. I made some mistakes
						but I tried my best. Also today was payday and I was so excited to get paid but my boss said that he
					    wouldn't pay me my first week because it is a "fund week" so I was like nooooo. Now I'll have to wait
					    till next week.

				<h3 id="jujubean2"> Back to work (03/28) </h3>	
					<p> It's Saturday. So far I've been doing good and I like working here, all I've been doing is basic stuff
						though such as getting the drinks, refilling drinks, cleaning tables and the floor but I will soon 
						start taking the orders in the drive through. I was supposed to work for 8 hours today, from 12:00pm 
						to 8:00pm but at 3:00pm my boss told me I could go back home, he just said "Little by little" so I 
						headed back home and spent the rest of the day doing other stuff.

				<h3 id="jujubean3"> eLearning Day (03/26) </h3>
					<p> PSS finally had a snow day!! Everyone needed a day off and they finally gave us one. I can't believe we
						didn't have an eLearning day before. We had a lot last year but, anyways. My family and I took this day 
						off as a chance to go to Mishawaka's mall. It was pretty cool there. We did not buy anything at all but 
						it was nice walking around and seeing different stores.

				<h3 id="jujubean4"> Track Long Distance (03/24) </h3>
					<p> Today's Tuesday. I've been doing track for a few weeks but all I had been doing so far was short 
						distances (being a sprinter). I thought I was good at this but it turned out I wasn't so I switched 
						to long distance and I had my first practice today. We ran from PSS to Webster (6 miles approximately)
						and came back in about 20 minutes. It was crazy, I got really tired but I liked it, I think I'll get 
						the hang of it as days pass.

				<h3 id="jujubean5"> My new Job (03/23) </h3>
					<p> I've been looking for a job for a couple months now and I finally got one, at King Gyros. I had been 
						there a month ago asking if they were hiring and they said yes and told me to give them my phone 
						number and that they would call when they needed me. They never called me so I had thought they just 
						didn't want me to work there but then today they called me saying that I was hired. I was so excited 
						because this is my first formal job ever. I used to have one back in Mexico a few years ago but I only 
						worked there for two weeks and it was something not very formal so. I'll keep updating with new stuff 
						that happens.
